# Allscale SDK Template

Be aware, altering files from this repository may yield merge conflicts upon
updating. The setup script will replace this README, you are free to change and
commit it afterwards.

Clone this repository giving it the name of your project. Your project name
should only contain lowercase letters, digits and underscores. We will use
`demo_app` as example. Next run the setup script to initialize your code-base
providing the project name.

    $ git clone https://github.com/allscale/allscale_sdk demo_app
    $ cd demo_app
    $ scripts/setup/run demo_app

A module `app` has been created with some example code. Now continue with the
new README generated by the setup script.

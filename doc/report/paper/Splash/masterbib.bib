  Abstract                 = {Sediment storage of fecal bacteria has been observed for a long time. However, limited modeling efforts have been conducted to dynamically and explicitly study the impact of sediment on the transport of fecal bacteria. In this paper, a modeling framework based on the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code {(EFDC)} model has been proposed. Free and particle-associated fecal bacteria can be modeled explicitly using the developed model. A linear adsorption relationship is incorporated into the model to obtain a sediment concentration dependent attachment ratio. The deposition and resuspension fluxes of fecal bacteria across the sediment bed-water interface are calculated coupled with the sediment deposition and resuspension flux. The model was applied to hypothetical scenarios to evaluate the sediment impacts under ideal settling and resuspension conditions. A case study was provided to test the resuspension calculation of fecal bacteria under an artificial flooding condition. Using this model, the contributions of fecal bacteria from sediment bed and from the watershed can be modeled separately and explicitly.},

Yet, none has used vegetation for the purpose of inducing a straight channel to meander. A flume-based study was designed to alter the flow pattern within a straight, degraded stream corridor by using simulated emergent vegetation of varying density placed at key locations within the channel. Placement of vegetation zones was determined using an empirical relation for equilibrium meander wavelength based on the imposed flow rate. Surface flow velocities were quantified using particle image velocimetry. The study showed that (i) flow velocity can be markedly reduced within and near the vegetation zones, (ii) flow can be diverted toward the opposite bank, and (iii) vegetation density controlled the magnitude of these effects.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses the needs to establish a capability to provide real-time regional ocean forecasts and the feasibility of producing them on an operational basis. Specifically, the development of a Regional Ocean Forecast System using the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) as a prototype and its application to the East Coast of the U.S. are presented. The ocean forecasts are produced using surface forcing from the Eta model, the operational mesoscale weather prediction model at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). At present, the ocean forecast model, called the East Coast-Regional Ocean Forecast System (EC-ROFS) includes assimilation of sea surface temperatures from <I>in situ</I> and satellite data and sea surface height anomalies from satellite altimeters. Examples of forecast products, their evaluation, problems that arose during the development of the system, and solutions to some of those problems are also discussed. Even though work is still in progress to improve the performance of EC-ROFS, it became clear that the forecast products which are generated can be used by marine forecasters if allowances for known model deficiencies are taken into account. The EC-ROFS became fully operational at NCEP in March 2002, and is the first forecast system of its type to become operational in the civil sector of the United States.},

  Abstract                 = {Cobscook Bay is a macrotidal estuary situated near the entrance to the Bay of Fundy, where the mean semi-diurnal tidal range is 5·7 m. Vigorous tidal currents in the bay maintain cold water temperatures year-round and effectively exchange nutrients and other dissolved matter with offshore waters. Partly because of the cold water and tidal exchange, a net-pen salmon aquaculture industry has rapidly expanded in the last decade, raising questions about sustainable levels of production in the environmentally pristine bay. The present study addresses the question of dispersion and flushing of materials in the bay, using a three-dimensional numerical model to simulate the circulation driven by the semi-diurnal tide and runoff from principal rivers. With initialization based on May 1995 cruise data, the results show that the tidal-mean flushing times for neutral surface particles vary from less than one day in the main channel near the entrance to more than a week in the extremities of the inner arms of the bay. A bay-wide average flushing time is about two days, or four tidal cycles, but the detailed distribution is strongly influenced by a pair of counter-rotating eddies that forms in the central bay during each flooding tide. The eddy pattern preferentially directs the initial flood into a southern arm of the bay, where particles and dissolved materials are sequestered. The effective horizontal mixing coefficient in the main channel of the central bay is 300-400 m2 s-1, leading to rapid dispersal of particles and pollutants in the along-channel direction and into the shallow inner arms of the bay where they tend to accumulate. A map of tidal-mean residence time indicates that most current aquaculture sites are located in reasonably well flushed regions.},

  Abstract                 = {A numerical experiment is carried out to investigate the circulation of an ocean, driven by a prescribed density gradient and wind stress at the surface. The mathematical formulation includes in one model most of the physical effects that have been considered in previous theoretical studies. Starting out from conditions of uniform stratification and complete rest, an extensive numerical integration is carried out with respect to time. Care is taken in the final stages of the calculation to use a finite difference net which resolves the very narrow boundary layers which form along the side walls of the {basin.A} detailed description is made of the three-dimensional velocity and temperature patterns obtained from the final stage of the run. Since inertial effects play an important role in the western boundary current, it is possible to verify with a baroclinic model two results obtained previously with barotropic ocean models: 1) a concentrated outflow from the western boundary takes place along the upper boundary of the subtropic wind gyre; and 2) inertial recirculation may increase the total transport of the boundary current to a value well above that given by linear theory. In addition to the western boundary current, a strong eastward flowing current is found along the equator. Taking into account a difference in Rossby number between model and prototype, the intensity of the computed currents agrees very closely to observations in the Gulf Stream and the Equatorial Current.},

This study provides preliminary estimates of carrying capacity for a small (0.5 km2) semi-enclosed coastal inlet located on the eastern shore of Nova Scotia, Canada. The food supply to the system was determined from measurements of tidal exchange and particulate organic matter over the period of May to October 1986. The food demand, or the mussels' ration, was estimated from grazing experiments conducted in the field. Filtration rates were obtained for mussels feeding on the natural particle spectrum, without subjecting the inflowing water to disruptive pump action. Estimates of the mussels' daily ration (11 to 41 mg {POM/mussel} per day) were lower than those from other field studies, but comparable to laboratory-derived values. Food supply (g {POM/week)} was divided by food demand (g {POM/kg} mussels per week) to obtain weekly estimates of carrying capacity for the system. These values ranged from 2.0 to 6.0×105 kg of market-size mussels ({\textgreater}50 mm) depending on temporal variations in the food supply.},

  Abstract                 = {Aquatic vegetation plays an important role in the flow structure of open channels and thus changes the fate and the transport of sediment. This article proposes a three-dimensional turbulence model by introducing vegetation density and drag force into the control equations of water flow in the presence of vegetation. The model was used to calculate the impacts of submerged vegetation on the vertical profiles of longitudinal flow velocities, the changes of the depth-averaged flow velocities in a compound channel with emergent vegetation in the floodplain, the removal of suspended sediment from the channels by emergent vegetation, and the bed changes around and in a vegetated island. Numerical investigations show that aquatic vegetation retards flow in the vegetation zone, reduces the sediment transport capacity, and contributes to erosion on both sides of the vegetated island. Calculated results agree well with experimental results.},

  Abstract                 = {It is often advantageous to model a semi-enclosed estuarine or coastal embayment (e.g. fish farms or tidal inlets, or typhoon shelters) as a separate system within a larger water body connected to the outer sea. The water quality of the system depends crucially on its flushing time--the average time of a particle in the system. The flushing time is governed by the barotropic and baroclinic tidal exchanges between the system and the outer sea. We describe herein a general method to determine systematically the flushing time of a stratified water body via a numerical tracer experiment. Numerical solution of the {3D} flow and mass transport equations for many practical problems show that the tracer mass removal process depends on the physical topography and bathymetry, tidal range and the degree of stratification in the outer sea. Field application suggests that the tracer mass variation can be well approximated by a double-exponential decay curve that can be described by three flushing coefficients. Using a simple analytical two-segment model, the flushing coefficients can be given a clear physical interpretation, and the flushing time can be easily determined in terms of the coefficients. The method is illustrated by application to a number of tidal inlets in Hong Kong, in both the dry and wet season. The connection between the numerically determined flushing time and the traditional bulk flushing time obtained from salt-balance methods is established.},

These three steps are described mathematically. Measurements have been conducted with a 12-inch Gassonic-400 at a reciprocating compressor station of the Tenneco Gas Pipeline Company, Houston, Texas, {USA}, and with a 20-inch Q.sonic at the Bernoulli Lab of {N.V.} Nederlandse Gasunie in Westerbork, The Netherlands.

The model is used to examine the storm surge of November 1977. Calculations show reasonable agreement with observed surge elevations at coastal gauges, but more interestingly show a rapid spatially and temporally evolving flow field. Such a time evolving flow field has a significant influence upon the movement of pollutants, in particular strong bottom currents which influence sediment movement.},

  Abstract                 = {In the context of aquaculture, carrying capacity is generally understood as the standing stock of a particular species at which production is maximised without negatively affecting growth rates. The estimation of carrying capacity for aquaculture is a complex issue. That complexity stems from the many interactions between and among cultivated and non-cultivated species, as well as between those species and their physical and chemical environments. Mathematical models may help to resolve these interactions, by analysing them in a dynamic manner. Previous carrying capacity models have considered the biogeochemical processes that influence growth of cultivated species in great detail. However, physical processes tend to have been addressed very simplistically. Further, most modelling has been for monocultures, despite the increasing importance of multi-species (=polyculture) systems. We present here a two-dimensional coupled physical-biogeochemical model implemented for Sungo Bay, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China. Sungo Bay is used for extensive polyculture, where bivalve shellfish and kelp are the most important cultivated species. Data collected over 13 years (1983-2000) was available for modelling. Our main objectives were to implement the model, achieving reasonable calibration and validation with independent data sets, for use in estimating the environmental carrying capacity for polyculture of scallops and oysters. Findings indicate that the model successfully reproduces some of the main features of the simulated system. Although requiring some further work to improve predictive capability in parts, predictions clearly indicate that Sungo Bay is being exploited close to the environmental carrying capacity for suspension-feeding shellfish. Comparison of different culture scenarios also indicates that any significant increase in yield will depend largely on a more optimal spatial distribution of the different cultivated species.},

  Abstract                 = {{NOAA} has developed a shore-based {HF} radar system that maps ocean surface currents out to 60 km from shore. Currents are derived from the Doppler shift of radar echoes from 6-m ocean waves, whose phase speed is altered by underlying currents. A map containing 800 current vectors covering 2000 square kilometers of ocean can be produced automatically in 45 minutes by a compact, transportable package that can be set up in about two hours. The {CODAR} system has been tested in measurements of the Gulf Stream off the Florida coast, tidal oscillations in Alaska's Cook Inlet and Puget Sound, and the complex outflow from the Savannah River off the Georgia coast. Comparison with surface drifters and a system error analysis indicate that {CODAR} measures surface currents with at least 10 cm/s accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {Details are given relating to the increasing use of numerical hydraulic and water quality models for environmental impact assessment studies and the increasing emphasis on more accurate numerical schemes for modelling the transport and dispersion of water quality constituents. Such a numerical model has been refined to modify a higher-order accurate finite difference scheme to eliminate the prediction of negative concentrations in a computationally efficient manner. This refined model has been applied specifically to predicting flow and water quality constituent processes within Poole Harbour, in Dorset, {UK}, with this natural harbour being a semi-enclosed coastal embayment. Details are given of the governing differential equations included in the model, together with details of the modified scheme, and predictions of various water quality indicators across the basin. The main sources of input into the basin include three sewage effluent treatment works and two rivers, inputting nitrates from agricultural run-off. The agreement between the predicted and the model results has proved encouraging, particularly since the basin floods and dries extensively during the tidal cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {{HF} radar in oceanography makes use of backscattering of electromagnetic waves of 10 m to 50 m wavelength from the rough sea surface to measure surface current and ocean wave parameters. In Germany, the work on ground wave {HF} radar started in 1980, adopting {NOAA's} {CODAR} {(COastal} {raDAR).} Recent developments within the European project {SCAWVEX} {(Surface} Current And Wave Variability Experiment) lead to a new design called {WERA} {(WEllen} {RAdar).} In Spring 1996, two {WERA} and {CODAR} systems have been deployed north and south the Rhine mouth at the Dutch coast. While {CODAR} uses a four-element squared receive antenna array and direction finding technique for azimuthal resolution, {WERA} in addition can be configured to use a linear array and beam forming. As both systems have been operated simultaneously at the same location, comparisons of the surface current fields measured by the different systems and algorithms are possible. By defining an absolute quality criterion based on spectral analysis of current time series, limitations in the direction finding algorithm concerning ship traffic can be identified},

Leapfrog gives error and run times comparable to those of the two time-level integrators. A second advection test case is performed to demonstrate how reflections at coarse/fine interfaces produced by leapfrog can be damped using edge smoothing. A strategy for staggered grid {AMR} is presented with velocities defined at cell vertices and tracer and pressure variables defined at cell centres {(B-grid).} A barotropic modon test case using numerics from a well-documented ocean model is used to demonstrate the ability of staggered grid {AMR} on a geophysical application. Again refinement regions are time-varying, but specified by the analytic solution.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on the detailed laboratory experiments and theoretical analysis, a new three-layer model is proposed to predict the vertical velocity distribution in an open channel flow with submerged vegetation. The time averaged velocity and turbulence behaviour of a steady uniform flow with fully submerged artificial rigid vegetation was measured using a {3D} Micro {ADV}, and the vertical distribution of velocity and Reynolds shear stress at different vegetation height, vegetation density and measuring positions were obtained. The results show that the velocity profile consists of three hydrodynamic regimes (i.e. the upper non-vegetated layer, the outer and bottom layer within vegetation); accordingly different methods had been adopted to describe the vertical velocity distribution. For the upper non-vegetated layer, a modified mixing length theory combined with the concept of [`]the new vegetation boundary layer' was adopted, and an analytical model was presented to predict the vertical velocity distribution in this region. For the bottom layer within vegetation, the depth average velocity was obtained by numerically solving the momentum equations. For the upper layer within vegetation, the analytical solution was presented by expressing the shear stress as a formula fitted to the experimental data. Finally, the analytical predictions of the vertical velocity over the whole flow depth were compared with the results obtained by other researchers, and the good agreement proved that the three-layer model can be used to predict the velocity distribution of the open channel flow with submerged rigid vegetation.},

For submerged vegetation, the whole flow is divided into four regions: external region, upper vegetated region, transition region and viscous region. According to the Karman similarity theory, the article improves the mixing length expression, and then gives an analytical solution to predict the vertical distribution of stream-wise velocity in the external region. For emerged vegetation, the flow is divided into two region: outer region and viscous region. In the two circumstances, the thicknesses of each region are determined respectively. The comparison between the calculated results and our experimental data and other researchers' data proves that the proposed model is effective.},

To remedy this deformation problem, we developed a specially designed tube-sinker to replace the weights that are commonly used at the bottom of cage nets. Herein, we describe the features of our new cage net system, the formation of motion equations, a new approach to estimating the volume reduction coefficient, and physical model tests in a hydrodynamic wave tank. Results of the numerical simulation and the experimental measurements show good agreement. This study indicates that the tube-sinker not only improves the volume reduction coefficient by 10\% for most wave conditions, but also that it significantly reduces severe fluctuations in volume deformation, thereby reducing fish fatalities due to skin abrasion with the net.},

  Abstract                 = {An investigation into the potential carrying capacity of suspended bivalve culture was undertaken using a linear food web model. The investigation involved configuring the model for the present state using all available information, and then perturbing the food web by introducing the bivalve culture until pre-determined carrying capacity limits were achieved. These carrying capacity trigger levels were defined by the production carrying capacity and the ecological carrying capacity. The production carrying capacity represents the theoretical maximum bivalve culture that could be supported in the embayment. This is defined as when the ecosystem collapses down to a nutrient-phytoplankton-culture-detritus dominated system. This level of culture was found to be a yield of bivalve culture of 310 t km-2 year-1 averaged across the bays in question. By contrast, the ecological carrying capacity was defined as the level of culture that could be introduced without significantly changing the major energy fluxes or structure of the food web. This limit was found to correspond to a bivalve culture yield of 65 t km-2 year-1 averaged across the bays. Introducing the large-scale bivalve culture resulted in a decrease in the mean trophic level of the ecosystem, an increase in the total yield, throughput and efficiency, and the bivalves replaced zooplankton as the major grazers in the modelled system.},

  Abstract                 = {A Reynolds stress model for the numerical simulation of compound open-channel flows with vegetation on the floodplain is described. The Reynolds stress model consists of various sub-models such as Speziale et al.'s model, Mellor and Herring's model, and Rotta's model for the pressure-strain correlation term, the turbulent diffusion term, and the dissipation term, respectively. For validation of the model, plain compound open-channel flows are simulated. The computed results were compared with measured data by {[Tominaga} A, Nezu I. Turbulent structure in compound open-channel flows. J Hydraul Eng, {ASCE} 1991;117(1):21-41] and the results show that the Reynolds stress model successfully simulates the mean flow and turbulence structure of plain compound channel flows. The model was then applied to compound open-channel flows with vegetated floodplains. Good agreement between the simulated results and data from an algebraic stress model by {[Naot} D, Nezu I, Nakagawa H. Hydrodynamic behavior of partly vegetated open channels. J Hydraul Eng, {ASCE} 1996;122(11):625-33] was found. However, it was shown that the {RSM} is capable of predicting the velocity dip and lateral shift in the maximum streamwise velocity, which were not observed in the data from algebraic stress modeling. Finally, a depth-averaged analysis of the streamwise momentum equation was performed to investigate the lateral momentum transfer in compound channel flows with vegetated floodplains. Compared with components by the secondary currents and Reynolds stress, the drag force due to the presence of vegetation appears to be a factor in reducing the bottom shear stress in both main channel and floodplain.},

  Abstract                 = {Details are given herein, of the development of an equation for predicting the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in riverine flows, based on 81 sets of measured data, and obtained from 30 rivers in the {USA.} This equation relates the dispersion coefficient to the hydraulic and geometric parameters of the flow and has been derived using dimensional and regression analysis, with a high correlation coefficient (i.e. R2=0.84). The formulation has been compared with many other existing empirical equations, frequently used to predict the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in riverine flows, with the comparisons based on four different statistical methods. These statistical comparisons have shown that the new equation appears to be more accurate than the other equations considered. The new dispersion equation was then linearly combined with a similar equation recently proposed by Seo and Cheong {(J.} Hydraul. Eng. {ASCE} 124 (1998) 25) and this combined equation was then also analysed using statistical methods. The existing empirical equations used to estimate the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and the new equations proposed in this study were included in the advective dispersion equation to predict the suspended sediment concentrations at three sites in the Humber Estuary sited along the northeast coast of England. The average percentage errors between the predicted- and measured-field data for the proposed new dispersion equations were less than those obtained using the previously documented equations.},

  Abstract                 = {Pronounced stratification and peaking operation, typical of reservoirs impounded by high-head dams, result in complex current patterns. These cause disorientation in downstream migrating salmon and interfere with downstream passage. Structural and operational modifications such as installations of curtains, surface withdrawal, draw down, and selective withdrawal are often considered to alter the stratification and modify the currents to enhance the movement of fish toward the forebay where they may be collected effectively. Effectiveness of design modification in deep reservoirs is highly dependent on site-specific hydraulic and meteorological conditions, and numerical models are the tools of choice in design and selection of the optimum alternative. Although most hydropower reservoirs exhibit a vertical-longitudinal {2-D} current structure, {3-D} flow patterns are prevalent in reservoirs with multiple branches, and they occur near the power intakes as well. Simulation of these currents requires a {3-D} hydrodynamic resolution. However, high-resolution hydrodynamic models, coupled with heat balance and water quality, have extensive computational demands and are unsuitable for iterative application or long-duration runs. An efficient strategy was developed where a vertical-longitudinal {2-D} heat balance model {(BETTER)} was used to generate rapid, year-long simulations of temperature and stratification in the reservoir. The predicted temperature distribution provided initial conditions for focused application of the {3-D} hydrodynamic model {(EFDC)} to predict current patterns during the fish migration seasons only. A Lagrangian particle tracking technique was used to rank the effectiveness of each alternative in terms of guiding fish to theforebay, thereby improving potential for success. Selective surface withdrawal was found to be the most effective way to improve currents for enhancement offish passage and help manage in-lake and discharge temperatures at Round Butte Dam in Lake Billy Chinook, Oregon.}

In addition, the {MY} model overestimated the turbulent energy dissipation. Based on the formulation of the k-[var epsilon] algebraic stress model, we modified the constant value C[mu](=0.09) in the standard k-[var epsilon] model to obtain the variables {C[mu]M} and {C[mu]H} to account for atmospheric stability. Finally, the results of the simulation obtained from the Wangara experiment verify the possibility of using the k-[var epsilon] algebraic stress model in atmospheric application.},

  Abstract                 = {The National High Frequency Surface Current Mapping Radar Network is being developed as a backbone system within the Integrated Ocean Observing System {(IOOS).} Of the core variables recognized in the {IOOS} Development Plan, two can be measured by high frequency radar {(HFR):} ocean surface currents and ocean surface waves. Rutgers University operates a nested multi-frequency network of {HF} radar systems along the coast of New Jersey. The network provides near real-time current observations with varying coverage from the coast to the shelf break. This is a subset of the larger regional coverage of the 26-site {Mid-Atlantic} {HF} Radar Consortium. The primary goal of this consortium is to operate the regional system in a coordinated way to guarantee the delivery of quality ocean current and wave data. In this paper we present the validation of both wave and current observations measured with this nested network. Particular emphasis is placed on surface current comparisons with Coast Guard deployed surface drifters {(SLDMBs)} and nearshore wave comparisons with moorings. The Coast Guard comparisons have a specific focus on quantifying the uncertainty in the {HF} radar surface current estimates as applied to search and rescue operations. These metrics will be used to ensure that quality data is going to the Coast Guard and that this information is properly incorporated into existing search planning tools. The nearshore measurements focus on algorithm development projects to incorporate shallow water effects into the estimates of nearshore waves.},

  Abstract                 = {A network of high-frequency {(HF)} radars is deployed along the New Jersey coast providing synoptic current maps across the entire shelf. These data serve a variety of user groups from scientific research to Coast Guard search and rescue. In addition, model forecasts have been shown to improve with surface current assimilation. In all applications, there is a need for better definitions and assessment of the measurement uncertainty. During a summer coastal predictive skill experiment in 2001, an array of in situ current profilers was deployed near two {HF} radar sites, one long-range and one standard-range system. Comparison statistics were calculated between different vertical bins on the same current profiler, between different current profilers, and between the current profilers and the different {HF} radars. The velocity difference in the vertical and horizontal directions were then characterized using the observed root-mean-square (rms) differences. We further focused on two cases, one with relatively high vertical variability, and the second with relatively low vertical variability. Observed differences between the top bin of the current profiler and the {HF} radar were influenced by both system accuracy and the environment. Using the in situ current profilers, the environmental variability over scales based on the {HF} radar sampling was quantified. {HF} radar comparisons with the current profilers were on the same order as the observed environmental difference over the same scales, indicating that the environment has a significant influence on the observed differences. Velocity variability in the vertical and horizontal directions both contribute to these differences. When the potential effects of the vertical variability could be minimized, the remaining difference between the current profiler and the {HF} radar was similar to the measured horizontal velocity difference ({\textasciitilde}2.5 cm/s) and below the resolution of the raw radial data at the time of the deployment},

  Abstract                 = {Marine fish farming is an important commercial practice in Hong Kong. Marine fish farms located in eutrophic coastal waters often face the threat of severe dissolved oxygen depletion associated with algal blooms and red tides. On the other hand, mariculture activities also contribute to pollution. The sustainable management of mariculture requires proper siting of the fish farms and stocking density control. Both of these are related to the carrying capacity of the water body concerned, which is mainly governed by its flushing characteristics. A simple method to determine the carrying capacity of a fish farm has been developed by using three-dimensional {(3D)} hydrodynamic modelling and its effective coupling with a diagenetic water quality model. A systematic methodology using numerical tracer experiments has been developed to compute the tidal flushing in a fish farm. The flushing time is determined from the results of a numerical tracer experiment using robust {3D} hydrodynamic and mass transport models. A unit tracer concentration is initially prescribed inside the region of interest and zero elsewhere; the subsequent mass transport and the mass removal process are then tracked. The fish farms are usually situated in well-sheltered shallow embayments and may not connect directly to the open water. It is found that it is necessary to define both "local" and "system-wide" flushing times to represent the effectiveness of the mass exchange with the surrounding water body and the open sea respectively. A diagenetic water quality model simulating the sediment-water-pollutant interaction is employed to address the response of the water column and the benthic layer to pollution discharges. With the flushing rate reliably computed, the carrying capacity of the fish farm can be determined in terms of key water quality parameters: chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, organic nitrogen and potential lowest dissolved oxygen level on a day of negligible photosynthetic production. The predictions are well-supported by field data.},

  Abstract                 = {Vegetation in rivers, estuaries and coastal areas is often submerged and highly flexible. The study of its interaction with the ambient flow environment is important for the determination of the discharge capacity, morphological characteristics and ecological conditions of the water course where it grows. In this work the hydrodynamics of submerged flexible vegetation with or without foliage is investigated by using a {3D} numerical model. Flexible vegetation is modeled by momentum sink terms, with the velocity-dependent stem height determined by a large deflection analysis which is more accurate than the previously used small deflection analysis. The effect of foliage on flow resistance is expressed in terms of the change in the product of the drag coefficient and the projected area, which is supported by available experimental data. The computed results show that the vertical profiles of the mean horizontal velocity and the vertical Reynolds shear stress are correctly simulated. The temporal variation of the stem deflection follows closely that of the velocity and the {[`]Honami'} phenomenon can be reproduced. The numerical simulations also confirm that the flexibility of vegetation decreases both the vegetation-induced flow resistance force and the vertical Reynolds shear stress, while the presence of foliage further enhances these reduction effects.},

  Abstract                 = {The flow division at an open channel junction is affected by the inflow discharge and the downstream water depths of the junction. The growth of vegetation in a channel system is environmental friendly, but its effect on the flow in an open channel junction can be significant. In this work a {3D} {RANS} {(Reynolds} Averaged {Navier-Stokes} equation) model has been implemented to investigate the flow phenomena in channel junctions with or without vegetation. The model is first validated by two cases: flow in an open channel T-junction without vegetation, and flow in a single open channel with vegetation. The model is then applied to simulate flow in an open channel T-junction with varying width ratio and vegetation density of the branch channel. The results quantitatively predict the trend of increasing flow in the branch channel with the increase in branch channel width and/or the decrease in vegetation density. The overall energy loss coefficient of the system, however, decreases with the amount of flow in the branch channel.},

The measurements enable us to derive profiles of stress, turbulent kinetic energy {(TKE)}, the rate of production and dissipation of {TKE}, eddy viscosity, diffusivity, as well as mixing length, and to test the parameterization of dissipation rate in the model of Mellor and Yamada. At middepth in the channel where the influence of stratification was present, the Ellison length agrees with the Ozmidov length. The measured mixing length is smaller than the simple z-dependence formulation proposed for unstratified turbulence. The diffusivity of density and heat, and the viscosity for momentum, are correlated and comparable in magnitudes. The 20-min averaged production rate deduced from the {ADCP} agrees with the dissipation rate estimated from microstructure measurements. The dissipation rate calculated with the {Mellor–Yamada} model agrees with the measured values w...},

  Abstract                 = {Models and tools for assessing the carrying capacity of an area of interest for bivalve culture can be classified according to their level of complexity and scope. In this report, we discuss and outline four hierarchical categories of carrying capacity studies: physical, production, ecological, and social carrying capacity. The assessment of carrying capacity for progressively higher categories of models is based on a sound understanding of preceding categories. We discuss each in brief and the third in more detail as this is the level at which knowledge is the most lacking and for which science may make the most advances. (1) Physical carrying capacity may be assessed by a combination of hydrodynamic models and physical information, ideally presented and analysed within a Geographic Information System {(GIS).} (2) Most scientific effort to date has been directed towards modelling production carrying capacity and some of the resulting models have been used successfully to this end. Further development of these models should pay attention to (i) better modelling of feedback mechanisms between bivalve culture and the environment, (ii) a consideration of all steps in the culture process (seed collection, ongrowing, harvesting, and processing), and (iii) culture technique. (3) The modelling of ecological carrying capacity is still in its infancy. The shortcomings mentioned for models for production carrying capacity estimates are even greater for ecological carrying capacity models. {GIS} may be employed to consider interactions between culture activities and sensitive habitats. (4) It is recommended that social carrying capacity be evaluated only after the preceding levels have been completed so that an unbiased assessment is obtained. This however does not exclude direction from managers for scientists as to which factors (such as water clarity, specific habitats, etc.) should be evaluated. The use of expert systems to aid in management decisions is briefly discussed with a suggested application of a fuzzy expert system to this end.},
  Annote                   = {(1) Physical carrying capacity: Describes area that is geographically available and adequate for a certain type of aquaculture.
{(2)Production} carrying capacity: Optimized level of production of the target species. Will mainly depend on natural resources.
(3) Ecological carrying capacity: maximum level of production which is possible without having an unacceptable ecological impact.
(4) Social carrying capacity: combines above three categories of carrying capacity as well as tradeoffs between all stakeholders in order to meet the demands of both the population and the environment.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a comparatively simple technique based on overlapping domain decomposition for the transformation of serial computational algorithms of ocean circulation models into parallel ones. The advantage of the proposed technique is that only additional procedures using basic {MPI} functionality are required instead of a significant transformation of serial code. The method is fairly efficient for computations on comparatively inexpensive clusters, which are usually affordable for small companies. The impacts of various factors, which may affect the method efficiency are studied.},

  Abstract                 = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The} need for an ecosystem approach to aquaculture has led to the development of several aquaculture analysis tools in recent years, working at different scales of space (farm- to system-level), time (seasonal to annual and/or long-term analysis) and complexity (ease of use to complex process-based modelling). This work has tested the application of a range of complementary tools to the analysis of aquaculture practices and ecosystem impacts in Killary Harbour, Ireland. The selected tools included a system-scale, process based ecological model {(EcoWin2000)}, a local-scale carrying capacity and environmental effects model {(FARM)} and a management-level eutrophication screening model {(ASSETS).} Both the system-scale and farm-scale models used {ShellSIM} to simulate individual shellfish growth. The tools were used to analyse the relationship between shellfish productivity and food sources, the impacts of changes to stocking densities of shellfish, and an overall assessment of the ecological status of Killary Harbour. {EcoWin2000} was able to support a complex analysis, but required a significant amount of input data and effort for calibration and result analysis. {FARM} was able to provide similar (although less detailed) results at the shellfish farm scale with a smaller effort for parameterization and application, but was limited to testing scenarios with relatively moderate changes to present-day conditions. {ASSETS} provided simple, management-level results with a relatively low level of input data, although it is not appropriate for complex analysis. This paper illustrates the complementary nature of these tools, and how the unique capacities of each can be combined for integrated assessment of aquaculture in a coastal system. For Killary Harbour, the combined application of these tools revealed that: (i) the system's eutrophication status can be classified as Moderate Low, with a future trend of No Change; (ii) there is a large influence of ocean boundary conditions on shellfish food resources in the system; (iii) the maximum mussel production of the system is 4200 ton year- 1, but achieving this level would lead to lower harvest weights and longer growth cycles; and (iv) a scenario of lower stocking densities proposed for the system should lead to lower mussel productions, but could result in benefits such as higher mussel weight at harvest and/or shorter growth cycles.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  Abstract                 = {Drag measurements are conducted to determine if inhalant and exhalant of fluid during mussel feeding has a detectable influence on the drag of a mussel-encrusted rope such as is commonly used in suspended aquaculture. The experiment is conducted using an artificial mussel crop rope constructed using the shells of Perna canaliculus, with 100 mussels (mean shell length 83.4 mm, {S.D.} 8.7 mm) attached over a length of 0.90 m. Fluid pumping from mussel feeding is simulated using inhalant and exhalant jets pumping at a rate of 7 L h-1 per mussel. The mussel rope is towed at speeds between 0.05 and 0.4 m s-1. No significant difference is found between drag with and without the mussels pumping indicating that assessments of the drag on or from mussel long-lines may safely neglect the effect of mussel feeding. We suggest using twice the mussel shell size to define mussel rope diameter which gives a drag coefficient of {CD} {\textasciitilde}1.0. A value of {CD} {\textasciitilde}1.3 is obtained if the projected area of the mussel rope is used. Particle tracking velocimetry {(PTV)} is also used on a similar but shorter crop rope (0.3 m length) in a recirculating flume which reveals that mussel pumping induces only small changes to mean velocity and turbulence distributions downstream of the rope. The wake of the crop rope is highly turbulent and dominated by shear instabilities formed in the free shear layer, similar to bluff body wakes. The sharp edges of the mussel shells provide many points for flow separation to occur. At typical ambient velocities, turbulent kinetic energy produced by the exhalant jets is small in comparison to that from flow around the crop rope.},

  Abstract                 = {Oceanographic Engineering of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Woods Hole, {MA} 02543. Oceanographers have long sought to verify the theoretical Ekman transport relation, which predicts that a steady wind stress acting together with the Coriolis force will produce a transport of water to the right of the wind. In situ measurements of wind and ocean currents provide a detailed view of this phenomenon. By separating the wind-driven current from the measured total current and by averaging over a long record, it is found that the observed transport is consistent with theoretical Ekman transport to within about 10 percent. In this case the wind-driven transport is strongly surface trapped, with 95 percent occurring in the upper 25 meters as a result of fair summer weather.},

  Abstract                 = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}In} wetlands wind-induced turbulence significantly affects the bottom boundary, and the interaction between turbulence and plant canopies is therefore particularly important. The aim of this study is to advance understanding of the impact of this interaction in submerged aquatic vegetation {(SAV)1} on vertical mixing in a fluid dominated by turbulence. Wind-generated turbulence was simulated in the laboratory using an oscillating grid. We quantify the vertical distribution of turbulent kinetic energy {(TKE)2} above and within different types of vegetation, measured by an acoustic Doppler velocimeter. Experimental conditions are analysed in two canopy models (rigid and semi-rigid) with seven solid plant fractions {(SPFs)3}, three stem diameters (d)4 and three oscillation grid frequencies (f)5 and four natural {SAVs} {(Cladium} mariscus, Potamogeton nodosus, Myriophyllum verticillatum and Ruppia {maritima).{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Our} observations suggest that the {TKE} above the constructed canopies was higher than that found without plants. The vertical profile varied according to the diameters of the individual stems and the {SPF.} Within the canopies, two zones could be distinguished. The [`]transition zone', situated a few centimetres below the top of the canopy, was characterised by a reduction in the {TKE.} Below the transition zone, the {TKE} progressively decayed as the stems dissipated the turbulence, creating a zone where the {TKE} was lower than in the zone without stems. This is a well-known effect of {SAV} on turbulence, called sheltering or dampening. This phenomenon was enhanced by a decrease in the stem diameter and an increase in the {SPF} of the canopies, due to the reduction of the plant-to-plant distance. We have, therefore, not only observed a sheltering, but quantified it. The development of the sheltering slowed as the frequency increased, because the vegetation could not prevent the penetration of the turbulence. In the semi-rigid model, no transition zone was found inside the canopies, while sheltering was found from the very top of the plants and was intensified inside the canopies. Finally, sheltering for {SAVs} was similar to sheltering produced by semi-rigid plants with widespread sheltering inside the canopy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  Abstract                 = {The ecological literature reveals considerable confusion about the meaning of validation in the context of simulation models. The confusion arises as much from semantic and philosophical considerations as from the selection of validation procedures. Validation is not a procedure for testing scientific theory or for certifying the ‘truth’ of current scientific understanding, nor is it a required activity of every modelling project. Validation means that a model is acceptable for its intended use because it meets specified performance requirements. Before validation is undertaken, (1) the purpose of the model, (2) the performance criteria, and (3) the model context must be specified. The validation process can be decomposed into several components: (1) operation, (2) theory, and (3) data. Important concepts needed to understand the model evaluation process are verification, calibration, validation, credibility, and qualification. These terms are defined in a limited technical sense applicable to the evaluation of simulation models, and not as general philosophical concepts. Different tests and standards are applied to the operational, theoretical, and data components. The operational and data components can be validated; the theoretical component cannot. The most common problem with ecological and environmental models is failure to state what the validation criteria are. Criteria must be explicitly stated because there are no universal standards for selecting what test procedures or criteria to use for validation. A test based on comparison of simulated versus observed data is generally included whenever possible. Because the objective and subjective components of validation are not mutually exclusive, disagreements over the meaning of validation can only be resolved by establishing a convention.},

  Abstract                 = {A method is introduced to determine the uncertainties in the predictions of oil spill trajectories using a classic oil spill model. The method considers the output of the oil spill model as a function of random variables, which are the input parameters, and calculates the standard deviation of the output results which provides a measure of the uncertainty of the model as a result of the uncertainties of the input parameters. In addition to a single trajectory that is calculated by the oil spill model using the mean values of the parameters, a band of trajectories can be defined when various simulations are done taking into account the uncertainties of the input parameters. This band of trajectories defines envelopes of the trajectories that are likely to be followed by the spill given the uncertainties of the input. The method was applied to an oil spill that occurred in 1989 near Sines in the southwestern coast of Portugal. This model represented well the distinction between a wind driven part that remained offshore, and a tide driven part that went ashore. For both parts, the method defined two trajectory envelopes, one calculated exclusively with the wind fields, and the other using wind and tidal currents. In both cases reasonable approximation to the observed results was obtained. The envelope of likely trajectories that is obtained with the uncertainty modelling proved to give a better interpretation of the trajectories that were simulated by the oil spill model.},

  Abstract                 = {In the California Current System {(CCS)}, upwelling is one of the most important features that enrich the coastal ecosystem. It is highly dependent on both wind stress and wind stress curl, because they contribute to the upwelling system through Ekman transport away from the coast and Ekman pumping as a result of the surface divergence, respectively. Various wind stress products are known to contain sharply different patterns of wind stress, and well-resolved wind forcing products have been shown to drive stronger upwelling due to their better-resolved wind stress curl in previous studies. However, sensitivities of upwelling to changes in wind stress patterns, and each of their control to the source waters and paths of the upwelling cells, are not yet well known for the {CCS.} Here we study these effects using the Regional Ocean Modeling System {(ROMS)} and its adjoint model under idealized wind stress forcing patterns representing three widely-used products in addition to a constant wind stress field (no curl): the {NCEP/NCAR} Reanalysis, the {QuikSCAT} satellite observations, and the Regional Spectral Model {(RSM)} downscaling.
Changes in currents and isopycnal patterns during the upwelling season are first studied in {ROMS} under the four different wind stress fields. The model simulations show that the locations of the core of the equatorward flow and the gradient of the cross-shore isopycnals are controlled by the wind stress curl field. The core of the equatorward flow is found under negative wind stress curl, and a deeper upwelling cell is found as the gradient from positive and negative wind stress curl increases. Source waters for the upwelling in each of the four wind stress patterns are investigated using the {ROMS} adjoint model. The simulations follow a passive tracer backward in time and track the source waters for upwelling in two key areas of interest: inshore and offshore of the Point Sur region of California. The upwelling source waters depend strongly on the depth of the upwelling cell and the alongshore current location. We further relate these results to recent studies of the observed trends in upwelling favorable winds and consequent wind stress curl changes in the {CCS.}},

Measurements of the {range-Doppler} spectrum of these signals yield the wavenumber k and the frequency [omega] of an ocean surface wave and its phase velocity[nu] = [omega]/[kappa] relative to the radar. Subtraction of the phase velocity of the wave in still water, c = [radical sign](g/k), yields a measure of the average current from the surface to a depth of the order of (2k)-1. A measure of the current shear is obtained by observing at more than one radio frequency. To test these ideas, surface currents were measured using both a conventional and the {HF} technique, and reasonable agreement was found.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent contributions to second-order turbulence modelling are reviewed with an emphasis on models of the coastal ocean. Classical and recent turbulence models are reformulated using a unifying notation, making differences in model structure and model parameters more transparent. The essential characteristics of a number of models are compared. It is further demonstrated that the mathematical stability and realisability of the models is crucial for practical applications. The parameter constraints to insure stable computations are discussed. Model performance is evaluated for a number of idealised entrainment scenarios that are typical for shelf seas: entrainment in linearly stratified and two-layer fluids caused by (a) surface wind stress (b) bottom stress due to water motion driven by a barotropic pressure gradient (c) bottom stress due to water motion in a bottom jet. It is shown that the predicted entrainment velocities are in good agreement with available laboratory data, provided the models have been calibrated according to a theoretical constraint. In addition, model behaviour in free convection is re-analysed with the help of recent data from large eddy simulations {(LES).} It is shown that even the most simple models, which do not solve a differential equation for the turbulent kinetic energy {(TKE)}, can approximately reproduce the entrainment depth, however, they fail completely in reproducing the correct budget of the {TKE-balance.} In contrast, second-order models solving transport equations for the {TKE} and a length scale determining variable are in reasonable agreement with the {TKE-budgets} from {LES.}},

  Note                     = {Abstract A three-dimensional, finite-difference model is developed to study limited-area (island) shelf circulation. The model uses a semi-implicit scheme in the cross-shore dimension and a mode-splitting technique in the vertical dimension, to achieve superior computing efficiency. The model was applied to a circular island to test its response under the joint effects of bottom topography and density stratification. For the homogeneous ocean case, model simulations agree well with analytical shelf wave theory. For the stratified ocean case. model results indicate formation of temperature fronts associated with coastal upwelling and downwelling. The model also was applied to the study of the transient shelf circulation off Peru with idealized shelf geometry and wind forcing. At the onset of equatorward (upwelling-favorable) wind, model simulation indicates equatorward flow throughout the water column. After ∼30 h, the equatorward flow propagates poleward out of the forcing zone with a phase speed of 200 k...},

  Abstract                 = {Aquatic vegetation has significant effects on flow in waters. In this article, four types of water areas were analyzed according to the field survey on water depth and vegetation in the Nansi Lake for the East Line Project of Water Transfer from South to North in China {(WTSNC).} The depth-averaged {2-D} hydrodynamic models with and without consideration of the effects of aquatic vegetation on flow were established to simulate flow fields in vegetated and non-vegetated zones in the Nansi Lake. With the established models, flow fields were predicted under the conditions of water transfer from south to north. The results indicate that when the drag force term exerted by aquatic vegetation is considered, the computed velocities agree well with the measured data, whereas as the drag term is taken into account, the computed velocities are obviously larger than the measured data in the vegetated zone and considerably smaller in the non-vegetated zone, and the error range between the two velocities is large if this problem is dealt with the method of increasing the roughness coefficient of the lake-bed to reflect the vegetation drag force. In addition, it is demonstrated that the emerged vegetation exerts larger effects on flow than submerged vegetation comparing the results in the emerged vegetation (reed) zone {(EVZ)} and the submerged vegetation zone {(SVZ).}},

  Abstract                 = {A two-equation turbulence model (one equation for turbulence kinetic energy and a second for a generic turbulence length-scale quantity) proposed by Umlauf and Burchard {[J.} Marine Research 61 (2003) 235] is implemented in a three-dimensional oceanographic model {(Regional} Oceanographic Modeling System; {ROMS} v2.0). These two equations, along with several stability functions, can represent many popular turbulence closures, including the k-kl {(Mellor-Yamada} Level 2.5), k-[var epsilon], and k-[omega] schemes. The implementation adds flexibility to the model by providing an unprecedented range of turbulence closure selections in a single {3D} oceanographic model and allows comparison and evaluation of turbulence models in an otherwise identical numerical environment. This also allows evaluation of the effect of turbulence models on other processes such as suspended-sediment distribution or ecological processes. Performance of the turbulence models and sediment-transport schemes is investigated with three test cases for (1) steady barotropic flow in a rectangular channel, (2) wind-induced surface mixed-layer deepening in a stratified fluid, and (3) oscillatory stratified pressure-gradient driven flow (estuarine circulation) in a rectangular channel. Results from k-[var epsilon], k-[omega], and gen (a new closure proposed by Umlauf and Burchard {[J.} Marine Research 61 (2003) 235]) are very similar for these cases, but the k-kl closure results depend on a wall-proximity function that must be chosen to suit the flow. Greater variations appear in simulations of suspended-sediment concentrations than in salinity simulations because the transport of suspended-sediment amplifies minor variations in the methods. The amplification is caused by the added physics of a vertical settling rate, bottom stress dependent resuspension, and diffusive transport of sediment in regions of well mixed salt and temperature. Despite the amplified sensitivity of sediment to turbulence models in the estuary test case, the four closures investigated here all generated estuarine turbidity maxima that were similar in their shape, location, and concentrations.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary This paper investigates the variation of hydraulic roughness parameters with flow depth for submerged flexible vegetation. In an experimental study flexible grass canopies are used to examine the impact of stem height, grass type and degree of submergence on the flow resistance properties. Results reveal that Manning's n roughness coefficient increases with decreasing flow depth reaching an asymptotic constant at lower levels of vegetation submergence. Data suggest that the value of the constant is dependent on the vegetation height and the vegetation properties. Currently the {n-UR} method underpredicts the Manning's n and the data from this study extends the {USDA} method for lower bed slopes and for smaller {UR} values. The vegetal {drag-Reynolds} number model is extended for submerged flexible grass linings of differing heights and types. Similar values of the vegetative characteristic number k are evaluated as from previous studies yet for contrasting vegetation types. The vegetal drag coefficient value was found to be strongly correlated to the vegetation height, and follows a power law relationship. The exponent value was found to be independent of the vegetation characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {High-frequency radars measure projections of surface velocity vectors on the directions of the radar beams. A variational method for reconstruction of the 2d velocity field from such observations is proposed. The interpolation problem is regularized by penalizing high-frequency variability of the surface vorticity and divergence fields. Twin-data experiments are used to assess the method's skill and compare it with two well-known approaches to {HFR} data processing: conventional local interpolation and more sophisticated non-local scheme known as open-boundary modal analysis {(OMA).} It is shown that the variational method and {OMA} have a significant advantage over local interpolation because of their ability to reconstruct the velocity field within the gaps in data coverage, near the coastlines and in the areas covered only by one radar. Compared to {OMA}, the proposed variational method appears to be more flexible in processing gappy observations and more accurate at noise levels below 30\%.},

The system is {PC-controlled}, using a digital signal processor {(DSP)} to acquire and extract the velocity and backscatter amplitude data. Results from a series of tow-tank calibration tests demonstrate an accuracy in the order of 5 mm s-1 for data rates of 10 profiles/second over a 1-2 m range with 1.5-cm range bins. An expression for system accuracy is developed which allows generalization to other pulse-to-pulse coherent Doppler systems. We present data showing the systematic decorrelation of backscatter signals due to particle advection: increased decorrelation is seen in the transducer near-field. Example observations of velocity profiles in laboratory-generated waves are presented},

  Abstract                 = {The results from a {3D} non-linear k-[epsilon] turbulence model with vegetation are presented to investigate the flow structure, the velocity distribution and mass transport process in a straight compound open channel and a curved open channel. The {3D} numerical model for calculating flow is set up in non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinates in order to calculate the complex boundary channel. The finite volume method is used to disperse the governing equations and the {SIMPLEC} algorithm is applied to acquire the coupling of velocity and pressure. The non-linear k-[epsilon] turbulent model has good useful value because of taking into account the anisotropy and not increasing the computational time. The water level of this model is determined from {2D} Poisson equation derived from {2D} depth-averaged momentum equations. For concentration simulation, an expression for dispersion through vegetation is derived in the present work for the mixing due to flow over vegetation. The simulated results are in good agreement with available experimental data, which indicates that the developed {3D} model can predict the flow structure and mass transport in the open channel with vegetation.},

  Abstract                 = {A set of governing equations for turbulent flows in vegetated area were derived with the assumption that vegetation is of straight and rigid cylinder. The effect of vegetation on flow motion was represented by additional inertial and drag forces. The new model was validated by available experimental data for open channel flows passing through vegetated areas with different vegetation size, density and distribution. Numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data. Finally, the flow around a supposed isolated vegetated pile was simulated and the effects of vegetation density on the wake flow were discussed. It is found that the presence of vegetation, even at a very low density, has the pronounced influence on the dissipation of flow energy, both inside the vegetation domain and outside it in the wake flow region.},
